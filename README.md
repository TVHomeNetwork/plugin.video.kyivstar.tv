# Kyivstar TV plugin for Kodi media player.

Kyivstar TV is an interactive television with legal content from Ukrainian and international TV channels in HD and standard quality, as well as a wide library of movies, TV series, cartoons and shows.

This plugin is based on: https://github.com/david-hazi/plugin.video.sweettv

# Installation:

Download the repository as ZIP. Unpack somwhere.
Rename the top directory from *plugin.video.kyivstar.tv-main* to *plugin.video.kyivstar.tv*.
Pack back to ZIP and install this file in Kodi.

# Setup:

The plugin works only if the user has logged in to his account. If you don't have an account, you can use the free option to watch channels from Kyivstar TV. To do this, you need to log in as anonymous.
    1. After installation, go to *Settings->Add-ons->My add-ons->Video add-ons->Kyivstar TV* and select *Configure*.
    2. In *Account* section, click on *Login* button. You have three options to log in: with phone number(need to input full number, 38xxxxxxxxxx), with personal account(in username field you need specify personal account number) and as anonymous.
    3. In *M3U* section, specify the file name and directory path in which the file will be ctreated.
    4. In *EPG* section, we do the same. You can also specify the time of daily update.
    5. Click OK and plugin will create two files.
It will take more time to create EPG file, because for each channel there are need separate request. Options to contol this process are in *EPG->Save options*.
